{ NOTE: at some point I need to flesh this out. Right now, it's just a reminder for myself. }

Here's what you need to do to get started:

- Download and install the latest version of Blender
- If you don't have Visual Studio Code on your machine, download and install it
- Install the [Blender Development]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development) Code extension

When you are going to do a coding session, you need to connect Code to Blender. Press Control-shift-P, then type "Blender: Start" and press return. It'll ask you {which version of Python?}. Press enter, and it'll start up Blender.

Now that Code is connected to Blender, you're ready to go!

Each time you want to run your script:

- Press Control-shift-P, then type "Blender: Run Script" (this will get tedious, so you'll probably want to set up a shortcut key to do it) {I forget if it asks you a question; if it does, the correct answer is to press enter}
- Switch to Blender and see the results!
- If you are doing a series of little experiments, you'll need to get rid of what your script created. At least so far, I found that I can do that by clicking somewhere on the screen and then pressing Control-Z
