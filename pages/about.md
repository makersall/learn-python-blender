Sometimes teaching an intro programming class feels a little weird. There's all this really cool stuff you can do with coding these days, and yet most intro classes don't get to play with it.

This site is a small pilot project to see what it would be like to teach Python to "Adventurous beginners" where they got to play with cool toys from the jump.

For now, this site is a thought experiment by me (Anders Schneiderman). Right now, it's nowhere near being something I would use to teach anyone, let alone folks in the community who are nervous about learning coding. If it gets to the point where it starts to feel like it might actually go somewhere, I'll start inviting other people in.
